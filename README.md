## Project Overview
In this project,our group is going to build a responsive application where users can search for a word to retrieve a definition from the Merrian Webster Dictionary and a definition from the Urban Dictionary.The result will show the users the real definition of the word as a slang definition.

## Languages and Libraries:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Google
* W3school
* API
* Node
* 

## User story:
Slang! It makes language professors crazy and helps the rest of us express ourselves more colorfully. One of the coolest things (and most annoying for language learners) about slang is that it is ever changing. The meanings of slang words evolve over time to reflect the values and attitudes of the culture, and sometime slang gives standard words new meaning. 
As product of the internet age ,anyone can suggest a new word—or a new definition of a word—years before establishment lexicographers catch on. 
Originally, Urban Dictionary was intended as a dictionary of slang or cultural words and phrases, not typically found in standard dictionaries, but it is now used to define any word, event, or phrase (including sexually explicit content).
​
## User Functionality:
User can get top 2 definitions from both dictionaries.
User can learn more interesting words from urban dictionary from our daily recommandation.
